The config variable is **global STDClass $C**. It has no required property, so it is optional unless:
  * You want hierarchy friendly urls (/parent/child)
  * You want to enable development environment status [#Development](#Development.md) or you want to see the php errors ( default is live )
  * You want to add another class directory [#classes\_dirs](#classes_dirs.md)
  * You want to add a custom config variable (**note: array config variables will be converted to STDClass**)

## Important Properties ##

### path ###
The path (url) of the application, **with trailing slash**

eg. /add-adodb-admin/

### environment\_status ###
Environment Status (to be called application\_status on a future version) is a config property that switches various applications processes for proper handling on live or development status

#### Live ####
On "live" status, **all errors are not printed**. Programmatically, to check if the application is on this mode, use add::is\_live() method.

For security purposes, **"live" is the default application status**.

#### Development ####
"development" status indicates that the only user of the application is the developer(s) themselves.

Error reporting is set to E\_ALL and some debugging data will show on the end of the script. Mailed exceptions are also not mailed but instead echo'ed

#### Development status on non-developer view ####
Since 0.10.4 , "development" environment status is reverted to "live" when the user is not detected as a developer.

#### Example use of add::is\_live() ####
```
<?php
/**
 * Register Controller Class
 */
CLASS ctrl_page_register EXTENDS ctrl_tpl_page {
   protected $mode_gpc_register = array(
         '_POST' => array('email','password')
      );

   /**
    * Registration mode, checks the email first if the environment status is live
    *
    * @param array $gpc
    *
    */
   public function process_mode_register($gpc) {
      extract($gpc);



      if (add::is_live()) {
         filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL);
      }

      member::add_new($gpc);

   }
}

```


### developer\_ips ###
> An array of the ips of the developers of the application.

> This is used on built in functions for security, and this can also be used within the application according to your requirements.

example:
```
$C = array(
      'environment_status' => 'development'
      'developer_ips' => array('123.12.31.23','231.23.12.31')
   );
```

Note: see [#Development\_status\_on\_non-developer\_view](#Development_status_on_non-developer_view.md)



### classes\_dirs ###
Array of class directories aside from your application's classes and framework's application classes directories.

Good for having a class directory common for different applications.

#### classes\_dirs example ####
```
$C = array(
      'classes_dirs' => array( 
            # First priority includes/classes relative the root directory of the application
            'includes/classes',
            # A directory of common classes among applications
            '/var/www/my-common-php-classes/'
         )
   );
```

Note: the framework class directory is pushed on the end of the directory array.

If the class is not found on the directory **or sub directories** of the class directory, the framework then tries again on the next class directory and so on, the last directory to be checked is the framework `/classes/` directory.


### libs ###
An array of libraries with there "alias" as the index and the path to the initialization path as value.

```
   $C = array(
         /**
          * Library init files
          */
         'libs'  => (object) array(
               'adodb' => 'adodb/adodb.inc.php',
               'smarty'    => 'smarty/Smarty.class.php',
               'phpmailer' => 'phpmailer/class.phpmailer.php',
            )
      );
```

## Default Configs ##

This is how the default config variables when you do not set them on your config variable.

See Code: https://code.google.com/p/add-mvc-framework/source/browse/project/trunk/classes/add.class.php#106

```
   array(
         'super_domain'       => $domain_parts['super_domain'], # extracted from server host
         'sub_domain'         => $domain_parts['sub_domain'], # extracted from server host
         'path'               => preg_replace('/\/[^\/]*?$/','/',$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']),
         'root_dir'           => realpath('./'),
         'environment_status' => 'live',
         'developer_ips'      => array(),

         /**
          * Library init files
          */
         'libs'  => (object) array(
               'adodb' => 'adodb/adodb.inc.php',
               'smarty'    => 'smarty/Smarty.class.php',
               'phpmailer' => 'phpmailer/class.phpmailer.php',
            ),
         );
```

## Other Properties ##
Here are other properties that could be automatically generated by the framework but can be of good use within your application

  1. incs\_dir e.g. /var/www/forums/includes
  1. classes\_dirs e.g. /var/www/forums/includes/classes
  1. configs\_dir e.g. (deprecated[?]) /var/www/forums/includes/configs
